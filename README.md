This is a very simple application that is calculating the equi distance between boards so they are placed harmoniously.
We have a main board of length "sizeOfBoard".
And then we have X amount of the other boards that will come perpendicularly of that main board. We want to space them regularly.
This program takes into effect the width of the secondary boards.
It then calculate the distance between each secondary boards. This is the distance between two facing sides.
One of the secondary boards will be placed at the boarder of the main board on each border.

Example:

We have a main board of length 50
We have 4 secondary boards with a width of 2
Since there are 4 secondary boards, there will be 3 intervals.

The program will return the interval distance. So the distance between board 1, 2, 3 and 4 are equal.
